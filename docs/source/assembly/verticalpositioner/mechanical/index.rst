Mechanical Assembly
===================

The vertical positioner subsystem uses a rack-and-pinion mechanism to move the pipettor subsystem. A motor rotates the pinion and causes the rack to slide up and down, pushing the pipettor subsystem with it. The housing for the motor is be fixed in place. A plate on the motor housing holds the slider of a potentiometer, which moves up and down with the pipettor subsystem and senses the position of the pipettor subsystem.
