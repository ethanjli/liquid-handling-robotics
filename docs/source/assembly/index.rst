Standards
---------

Common standards are used across the liquid-handling robot to improve the clarity of design and assembly.

Mechanical
~~~~~~~~~~

All acrylic plates are 1/8 inch thick. (describe delrin rods and nylon washers) (describe tab-hole joints)

Electrical
~~~~~~~~~~

All components on the robot are connected by jumper wires. Components on the robot, such as motors and sensors, should have male connectors on them, either as male header pins or as wires with a male connector.

(insert image here)

Male-female jumper wires are used to connect components on the robot to the motor shield on the Arduino board.

Black jumper wires are used for ground wires; red jumper wires are used for power. White jumper wires are used for sensor signals. Red and blue (or gray, if blue is not available) jumper wires may be used for power, such as for motors.
