Mechanical Assembly
===================

The pipettor subsystem uses a rack-and-pinion mechanism to move the plunger of the syringe. A motor rotates the pinion and slides up and down the rack, pulling and pushing the syringe plunger with it. A plate which travels with the motor moves the slider of a potentiometer, which senses the position of the plate.
